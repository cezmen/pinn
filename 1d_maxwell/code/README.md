# Python Code Example for PINN Simulations 


<br>

You can run this notebook on Google Colab by clicking the link below. You can also save a copy to your Google Drive for further customization.

The source code utilizes Google JAX, a Python library for array-based numerical computation with automatic differentiation. It runs efficiently on Google Colab instances using NVIDIA T4 GPUs, offering optimal performance for demanding computational tasks. While the code can also run on CPU instances, processing will take significantly longer to complete.
